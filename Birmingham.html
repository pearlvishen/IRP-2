    <h2> Birmingham, Alabama was the most segregated city in America, and the Birmingham campaign aimed to change that. Those who volunteered to protest were well trained and behaved with dignity. The training was difficult and cruel, but it truly prepared our supporters for what was to come. We preached nonviolence, but we were attacked nonetheless. Adults and children alike suffered at the hands of Birmingham officials and citizens. Protesters were attacked with dogs, hoses, and pepper spray. We did not back down. After every day of countless arrests, the protests grew stronger. Even I went to jail for the cause. In the end, our protests were successful. Thankfully, Connor and his supporters were removed from office, and the desegregation of Birmingham began. The events at Birmingham have propelled forward our revolution. We will not rest until we gain our God-given right to equality. </h2>
