  They think that they can control us through threats of pain. Their threats become null once we willingly succumb to them. We do not fear their violence. Once they lose what controls us, we can rise up. We are dignified by these moral, self-sacrificial acts. We submit ourselves to Jesus and God rather than the Devil of violence. Through peace, we are able to deny the degrading stereotypes that classify us as beasts and subhuman beings. We must show them that we are better.

         <br>"Nonviolence had tremendous psychological importance to the Negro... The Negro was able to face his adversary, to concede to him a physical advantage and to defeat him because the superior force of the oppressor had become powerless" (35).<br>
